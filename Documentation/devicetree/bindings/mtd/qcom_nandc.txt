* Qualcomm NAND controller

Required properties:
- compatible:		should be "qcom,ebi2-nand" for IPQ806x. You'll also need
			a compatible string for u-boots which populate the
			devicetree with flash partitions, such as
			"qcom,qcom_nand".
- reg:			MMIO address range
- clocks:		must contain core clock and always on clock
- clock-names:		must contain "core" for the core clock and "aon" for the
			always on clock
- dmas:			DMA specifier, consisting of a phandle to the ADM DMA
			controller node and the channel number to be used for
			NAND. Refer to dma.txt and qcom_adm.txt for more details
- dma-names:		must be "rxtx"
- qcom,cmd-crci:	must contain the ADM command type CRCI block instance
			number specified for the NAND controller on the given
			platform
- qcom,data-crci:	must contain the ADM data type CRCI block instance
			number specified for the NAND controller on the given
			platform

Optional properties:
- nand-bus-width:	bus width. Must be 8 or 16. If not present, 8 is chosen
			as default

- nand-ecc-strength:	number of bits to correct per ECC step. Must be 4 or 8
			bits. If not present, 4 is chosen as default
- nand-on-flash-bbt:	Create/use on-flash bad block table

The device tree may optionally contain sub-nodes describing partitions of the
address space. See partition.txt for more detail.

Example:

nand@1ac00000 {
	compatible = "qcom,ebi2-nandc","qcom.qcom_nand";
	reg = <0x1ac00000 0x800>;

	clocks = <&gcc EBI2_CLK>,
		 <&gcc EBI2_AON_CLK>;
	clock-names = "core", "aon";

	dmas = <&adm_dma 3>;
	dma-names = "rxtx";
	qcom,cmd-crci = <15>;
	qcom,data-crci = <3>;

	partition@0 {
	...
	};
};
